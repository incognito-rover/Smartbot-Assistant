Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. It is a branch of computer science dealing with the creation of smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

There are two types of AI: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI is designed for a specific task, like voice assistants or recommendation systems. General AI, which remains theoretical, would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI focused on the development of systems that learn from data. These systems improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed for each task.

Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, uses neural networks with many layers. It has been responsible for major advances in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.

The ethical implications of AI include privacy concerns, job displacement, and decision-making transparency. As AI continues to evolve, it is critical to develop policies that guide its development and deployment responsibly.
